# CallMap

Map method and function calls to the methods or functions in which they happen.

## Purpose

This allows to create a mapping file that can be used to generate an overview of which method is called where.

Whether that is to generate a graphical overview or to check which Namespace boundaries are crossed is a
separate topic then.

The package itself is a plugin to pPHPStan.
